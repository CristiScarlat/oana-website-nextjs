I am not quite sure whether i am dreaming or remembering, whether i have lived my life or dreamed it.Just as dreams do, memory makes me profoundly aware of the unreality, the evanescence of the world, a fleeting image in the moving water." Eugen Ionescu</span></div>

        <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="color: #cccccc; line-height: 115%;">Sleep represents the most important source of rest.
        But at the same time, it is a strange universe, intriguing and troublesome,
        because it suppresses alertness, removes thought control, deletes the everyday
        existence, cuts off relations with the surrounding world.&nbsp;</span></span><br>
        <span style="color: #cccccc; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; line-height: 115%; text-indent: 35.4pt;">Through this exhibition I am proposing a fascinating
        and miraculous journey through the world of dreams. It's a slow trip, leisurely
        among states, motives and thoughts - a floating inner self in a world that no one
        can access only by dreaming, that state of daydreaming, and hallucinatory
        states occurring in standby and then deepen into REM sleep where dreams occur.&nbsp;</span><br>
        <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="color: #cccccc; line-height: 115%;">REM dreams (Rapid Eye Movement - a stage of sleep
        characterized by rapid eye movements under closed eyelids) resembles a narrative
        in which the sleeper assists like a foreign spectator, to the images triggered
        by sleep, having a sense of belonging to another world, an alternate reality.</span></span><br>
        <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="color: #cccccc; line-height: 115%;">The light show that will be revealed in this
        exhibition presents itself for the viewer standing in front of the canvas, but also for the pictorial
        space traveler, which represents the viewer’s substitute.</span></span><br>
        <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="color: #cccccc; line-height: 115%;">The exhibition involves a journey that starts with
        leaving the standby state and entering into the dream-state of REM sleep.</span></span><br>
        <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="color: #cccccc; line-height: 115%;">The throughput is measured in steps, each piece
        bearing a number (from1 to16) which corresponds to the depth of the oniric
        space that will end with the return to the real world.</span></span><br>
        <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="color: #cccccc; line-height: 115%;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #cccccc; line-height: 115%;">Entering the dream already starts when the curtain is
        drawn aside. At this point we are going to leave the real world and enter the
        world of dreams.</span></span><br>
        <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="color: #cccccc; line-height: 115%;">The key to interpreting the exhibition is given by the
        idea of generation and coverage, meaning that each painting can contain the
        other. They bind and are born from one another. Each painting flows from the
        latter, like the stories of the <i>One Thousand and One Nights</i>.</span></span><br>
        <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="color: #cccccc; line-height: 115%;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #cccccc; line-height: 115%;">I have thus created a continuum in which the
        character, along with the viewer, move from one dimension to another. He enters
        a space from which he passes to the next one only when moving to the next
        painting and throughout his journey he finds the previously seen ones.</span></span><br>
        <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="color: #cccccc; line-height: 115%;">The journey is an ascending path following a route
        where the traveler, ranging all the while a state of wonder is constantly
        searching and exploring the fascinating world of dreams which opens in front of
        him. The ascending journey will end with the apparition of the ladder pointing
        up, but not toward heaven, toward the Earth as a symbol of returning, of
        awakening.</span></span><br>
        <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: #cccccc;">The last work, <b>Hypnotic</b>
        (16) - which gives the title of this exhibition - is strewn with the remains of
        the oniric experience through a few plastic recurring elements, from the works
        already seen and represents the lane of return, the return to the state of awakeness
        and to the real world.</span></span></span></div>`},

        The paintings are surprising the Magician in his ordinary life habits.There are always hidden objects to be found in the paintings.The Magician is playing with us hiding them from our eyes.As long as the Magician is passing the landscape there will always be hidden elements to look for!</div>
        The space here can suddenly be changed by his magical power.That’s why I surprised him having <i>A Vision</i> and suddenly proceed to transform the surroundings…closing his eyes behind a closed door and prepare a key to suddenly appear from a flower or crossing a forest rolling on a big ball…this is the Magician.<br>

        <i>Childhood Spaces</i> show images of my own childhood bringing an internal pulse to the paintings surface and so, creating an atmospheare of contemplation.
        I used the symbol of the House&nbsp; and the Window with all their meanings as main elements in the paintings.The House is the shelter where you can refuge, protect and keep your precious things.The Window is the one the House is using to confess itself to the world…as much as it can…</div>`
